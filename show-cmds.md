Here are 12 important "show" commands you can use in Cisco Packet Tracer:

**Interface Status and Configuration:**

1. `show ip interface brief`: Provides a quick overview of interface statuses, IP addresses, and administrative states.
2. `show ip interface <interface name>`: Shows detailed configuration and statistics for a specific interface.

**Routing:**

3. `show ip route`: Displays the routing table, listing networks, subnet masks, next hops, and administrative distances.
4. `show ip protocols` (or specific protocol commands like `show ip rip routing-table` for RIP): Provides information about routing protocols, including learned routes.

**Learning and Forwarding:**

5. `show mac-address-table`: Lists all learned MAC addresses on switch interfaces, including VLANs and aging timers.

**VLANs:**

6. `show vlan brief`: Offers a summary of configured VLANs, including IDs, names (if assigned), and statuses.
7. `show vlan <vlan ID>`: Displays detailed information about a specific VLAN, including name, status, assigned ports, and trunking details.

**Trunking:**

8. `show interfaces trunk`: Lists all trunk interfaces and their configurations, such as trunking mode, encapsulation, and allowed VLANs.
9. `show trunk <interface name>`: Provides in-depth information about a specific trunk interface, including its mode, encapsulation, native VLAN, and allowed VLANs.

**Configuration and Information:**

10. `show running-config`: Displays the currently active configuration of the device, including all configured commands.
11. `show version`: Shows information about the device's operating system (IOS) version, hardware, and uptime.

**Additional Useful Command:**

12. `show ip arp`: Lists the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) table, which maps IP addresses to MAC addresses for recently communicated devices.

Here are 10 more important "show" commands you can use in Cisco Packet Tracer:

**Security:**

13. `show ip access-list`: Displays configured access control lists (ACLs) used for filtering traffic based on source/destination IP addresses, ports, protocols, etc.
14. `show cdp neighbors`: Lists neighboring devices discovered through the Cisco Discovery Protocol (CDP), helpful for network topology visualization.

**Line Protocol and Errors:**

15. `show line <interface name>`: Displays detailed information about a specific serial interface, including its line protocol status (up/down), errors, and statistics.

**Memory and CPU:**

16. `show memory`: Provides an overview of memory usage on the device, including available and used memory for different components.
17. `show cpu`: Displays CPU utilization information, helpful for identifying potential performance bottlenecks.

**Processes and Services:**

18. `show processes`: Lists active processes running on the device, along with their CPU and memory usage.
19. `show ip bgp summary` (or similar for other routing protocols): Provides a summary of the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) or other routing protocol neighbors and their statuses.

**Other Useful Commands:**

20. `show clock`: Displays the current date and time on the device.
21. `show dns`: Shows information about configured DNS servers and their status.
22. `show ip telnet`: Displays information about active Telnet sessions connected to the device.

23. `show flash`: Displays information about the device's flash memory (total, free, and used space).
